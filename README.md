# Wav2Vec2 in Action: ASR and Artist Classification

This repository highlights showcasing the usage of the Wav2Vec2 model for different audio processing tasks:

1. **ASR Ukrainian**
2. **Audio Classification**

## 1. ASR Ukrainian

`Fine-Tune XLSR-Wav2Vec2 on Ukrainian ASR with ðŸ¤— Transformers.ipynb` demonstrates how to use Wav2vec2 for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) specifically for the Ukrainian language. It covers:

* Loading a pre-trained Ukrainian ASR model.
* Preprocessing audio data.
* Transcribing audio into Ukrainian text.

## 2. Audio Classification

`Artists Classification TS-LC-RH-ID using Wav2Vec2-300m.ipynb` explores how Wav2vec2 can be utilized for classifying music artists based on their songs. It includes:

* Feature extraction from audio using Wav2Vec2.
* Training a machine learning model for artist classification.
* Evaluating the model's performance.
